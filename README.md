# AIS Winter Hackathon!!!

### Getting Started

To start the app, run the following commands:

- cd frontend
- npm install
- npm start

While that runs (it takes a minute), go to the app store and download the Expo Go app onto your phone. The Expo Go app is a platform for the react native app. Think of it as the mobile app version of http://localhost:3000

By the time the app has downloaded, you should see a qr code in your terminal window. Scan that qr code, and you're up and running!

### Logging In

The app will open on a login page. In the finished app, this will prompt you to go to the BYU SSO just like any other BYU site. For now, it simply prompts you for a netId. If you log in as an admin, you will be able to switch back and forth between the user and admin views, so the user profile is really only for testing.

-admin netId: johndoe24
-user netId: janesmith101
